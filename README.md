# FileRecoveryScript
Did you accidentally run git reset --hard and delete your entire desktop? If you're in this position, use this to save yourself some time and recover your files. 
Note: This was successful on MacOS. It may or may not work for other operating systems ***so try this at your own risk***. Also as of the latest version of this script. You will have to manually go through the files in order to determine what each file is since the old file name is not stored in memory. If you have any way to possibly make it easier or more recoverable, feel free to submit a pull request!
